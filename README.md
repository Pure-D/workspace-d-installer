# THIS PROJECT MOVED

It is now part of [workspace-d](https://github.com/Pure-D/workspace-d)

## workspace-d Installer

Runs all dub and git commands for you so you dont have to.

### Usage

Make sure dmd, dub and git are installed. Run `dub`.

```
dub
```

It will ask which components should be installed. If you
are using a fully featured workspace-d implementation like
`code-d` you need to install all components. (simply hit return)

Once done either copy all binaries in the `bin/` folder to some
folder in your PATH, link them to some folder in your PATH or
add `bin` to your PATH.
